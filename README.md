# Guest-House-Booking-System

//Java Software created using Netbeans and MySQL. Functionality includes allowing user to book rooms in available guest houses and allowing staff user to review bookings and feedback.

IIT Kharagpur has a number of guest houses in the campus, but the process of booking them is not unified and requires the presence of the customer in person. The purpose of Online Guest House Booking System is to eliminate the manual process and provide an online platform to book a room in one of the guest houses easily.

Any visitor who wishes to stay in the IIT campus has to visit the guest house in person to book a room. This may lead to a situation where no rooms are available for the visitor, or the visitor may not know the facilities provided by the guest house. All the identity verification and payment have to be handled by the guest house staff. This software eradicates this long process, by simply allowing a visitor to view the availability of guest houses, their facilities and the charges, further allowing him to register and verify and henceforth book a room, or in case of unavailability, get in the waiting list.

Funtional Requirements:

1. User Login and Registration
• The system provides a unique account/profile to a user which he can access after registering and verifying his account.
• The verification process requires government approved IDs at the time of registration.

2. Room Booking
• The user can book his room on the basis of availability. He has to provide his details such as name, their address, age, gender, relations, duration of stay in the guest house which are notified to the guest house staff.
• If there is no room available, the visitor can add him/her-self to the waiting queue.
• If there is any cancelation, the booking would be confirmed automatically.
• If the waiting queue is nil, the room availability status needs to be updated.
• After duration of stay is over, the room availability status is automatically updated.

3. Guest House Facilities
• The software allows the user to check food availability and price for any guest house.
• He/She can check availability of other facilities such as leisure activities, if provided by the guest house.

4. Payment System
• A payment system via a bank payment gateway is provided to the user to finalize the booking transactions.
• On booking a room, the visitor needs to pay 20% of the actual amount for booking.
• On cancelation of the room, fraction of the money would be deducted and the remaining amount would be returned. If the booking does not get confirmed, deposited money would be returned.
• Notifications are sent to the user regarding payment confirmation or a refund.

5. Feedback System
• There must be an online feedback system also for the visitors. Before leaving the guest house, the visitor would be asked to fill up a form with experience details, which would be helpful to upgrade the service quality.
